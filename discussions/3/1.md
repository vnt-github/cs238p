- use read, exec, open etc.
- read the man pages of commands.
- don't copy code from internet, as auto grader will check that.
- add **extra capabilities for extra credit**.
- line = ptr to the beginning value of address in real piece of memory in heap that points to sh_read_line()'s output, this is just the arguments line.
- args: pointer to strings that are arguments.
- pipes and redirection handled in sh_execute and sh_launch calls the actual command.
- assume there is always spaces between < and >.
    - open the redirected path.
    - before exec, redirect the input/output.

- cd and history are build in the shell and not an external command.
- clue: env. are passed to programs, and can requests to elements of from within you command.

- for file redirection: if file does not exist then we need to create it.
