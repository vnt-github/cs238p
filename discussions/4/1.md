- What are the direct-access storage devices for CPU?
    - registers
    - main memory
- Approximately how many CPU cycles does it take for CPU to access either built-in Registers or Main Memory?
    - 1 cycle: 0.5 nano seconds.
    - registers: 5 clock cycles: 2.5 nano seconds.
    - main memory: Over 100 clock cycles: 50 nano seconds.
- What is the issue in this pattern?
    - very high access time.
- What would be a possible solution.
    - Cache/memory buffer btw memory and registers.

- first fit and best fit are better than worst fit.
- external fragmentation: when enough total memory but not contiguous.
    - first-fit suffers it.
    - best-fit suffers it.
    - solution
        - compaction: shuffle memory content so as to place all free memory holes together in one large block.
            - when relocation is during runtime and not static then we can't do compaction.

- internal fragmentation: memory allocated - memory requested
    - the memory is split into mounted sized blocks
    - Whenever a method request for the memory, the mounted sized block is allotted to the method. 
    - just in case the memory allotted to the method is somewhat larger than the memory requested, then the distinction between allotted and requested memory is that the Internal fragmentation

16 bit address with page size = 1KB how many page entries.
- 1*2^10 so 10 bits base offset and 6 bits for offset.

- page size == frame size
